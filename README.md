# Encryptor
The point of this app is to encrypt a message using a salted password.
It will return a URL and we can navigate to that URL in order to enter
the password and decrypt this message.

To do this I used JQuery event listners and googles encryptor.

Run npm install to install mocha and chai!
then you can test the app by running mocha.
